## About Me

I am a Protein Engineer and Scientist specializing in Structural Biology and Virology. My work focuses on developing next-generation diagnostics and therapeutics through protein biology and computational design.

With a background in both wet-lab biochemistry and in-silico modeling, I bridge the gap between structural discovery and practical application.

## Research Highlights

- **Protein Engineering:** Innovating protein components for multiplex diagnostics using in-silico platforms.
- **Structural Biology:** Expertise in Cryo-EM of small membrane proteins, antibodies, and viral replication complexes.
- **Virology:** Elucidating assembly mechanisms of Alphaviruses and investigating drug discovery targets.

## Built With
